alpha0.4:
  * Alias objects implemented
alpha0.3:
  * User objects implemented
  	* User objects represent mail-accounts (please note the difference between
	a mail-account and an alias: mail-accounts are real accounts with a
	password, that can be used for fetching mails via Dovecot. Aliases are
	merely 'virtual mail addresses', that don't really exist, but are able to
	receive mails. Mails that are received by an alias are forwarded to
	another address, which is not necessarily of the same domain)
alpha0.2:
  * Domain objects implemented
  	* Domains can be created, modified and deleted
  * Database layer implemented
  	* DatabaseInterface and Database class are used by the real engine
	* the Database engines, i.e. DatabasePDO are another layer of abstraction,
	which will do the real work
alpha0.1:
  * project started
  * build the FrontEnd with a basic layout
